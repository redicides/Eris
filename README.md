## Self-Hosting

Thinking of self-hosting this thing? Alright, you’ll find all the details you need in the [`self-hosting guide`](/documentation/Self-Hosting.md). Take your time, follow the steps, and best of luck setting everything up.

## Contributing

Whether it’s fixing a bug, suggesting improvements, or adding new features, your help is always welcome. Let’s make the process as smooth as possible with a few simple guidelines:

### What You Can Contribute:

- Fix bugs or address reported issues.
- Enhance existing features or improve code quality.
- Add new features that align with the bot's goals (smaller, focused additions are best).
- Improve documentation to help others understand and use eris more effectively.

### Things to Avoid:

1. **Code Formatting:** No need to format manually; we use [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) for that!
2. **Typos:** While pointing out typos is great, please create an issue or let me know directly instead of making a pull request.
3. **Micro-optimizations:** Focus on meaningful improvements rather than tiny tweaks that don’t add much value.

### How to Contribute:

1. **Write Quality Code:** Keep it clean, readable, and in line with the project’s conventions. Clear comments are always appreciated!
2. **Use Prettier:** Format your code with the provided settings in the `.prettierrc.yml` file.
3. **Test Thoroughly:** Make sure your changes work well and don’t break existing functionality.
4. **Stay On Track:** Keep your contributions aligned with eris's purpose and goals to maintain focus.

Thanks!
